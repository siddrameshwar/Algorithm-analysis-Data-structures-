I have calculated Shortest distance from Graph Vertex 'A' in the code.

Steps to Run the code.

Step 1- Add these 3 java files in the package 'assignment4'
	Assignment4.java, GraphVertex.java, and GraphVertexList.java
Step 2- Compile Assignment4.java
Step 3- Run Assignment4.class.

I have attached 2 screenshots for the console output of the program.

I have also attached a pdf which pictorially depicts the graph used as example in the paper. 
It also has the shortest path Tree.
