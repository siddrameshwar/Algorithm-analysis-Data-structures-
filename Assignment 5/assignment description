Implement the DFS topological ordering.

Your directed graph must have at least 10 vertices and 15 edges.

You must run the algorithm on two sets of graphs.

1. The graph does not have a cycle.  It generates a correct topological ordering.

2. The graph has a cycle. It attempts to generate an order. But discovers the cycle and exits (some nodes will already be ordered.

Submit the code.

Submit screen shots of each execution.

You can print each of the graphs as adjacency matrix or other representation.
